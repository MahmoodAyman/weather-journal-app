# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview

This project is the second project of egFWD web development proffessional track.
weather-journal-app is a web application that allows users to know the weather by zip code using open weather map API.

- first I setup node.js and npm to install the dependencies
- I created an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.
- I used the following technologies:
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
  - [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- I created a server that listens on port 3000 and get and post requests
- most of the functions in my project are arrow functions and I added some coments to make it easier to read
